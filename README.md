## About me

â€‹	In the book, The Information, I read the following phase: What's the universe computes ? it's a good question, but the point is, what's Joseildo's Head computes ? i consider this one even better, and about this one I have good points about this one: first, talks about computers and what they are able to do, is with no doubt one of his preferred hobbies. Seconde, has a degree in computer science. Thrid, loves chess and play a lot of, but thinks that's a boring game. Forth, new programming languages is another hobbie.
